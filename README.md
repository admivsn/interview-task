# interview-task

The first hour of the technical interview is reserved three tasks:

1. **SQL task** (feel free to write pseudo SQL or any other type of SQL you prefer)
2. **Python OOP task** (fix the class)
3. **Python data science task** (work through the steps you would take such as loading data, EDA on features / target, preprocessing, modelling, evaluation, etc)

You can complete the tasks on your local machine or using this [prebuilt MyBinder environment](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/admivsn/interview-task/HEAD?labpath=README.md) which you can launch in your browser and contains all of the necessary packages.

The tasks are attached to this email, please navigate to the appropriate directory (e.g. Mid, Senior) to ensure you complete the correct tasks. On MyBinder use the folder icon on the top left.

We recommend you spend 10-15 mins on each of the first two tasks, and the remaining time on the final task.

Please respond to this email with your solutions. If you use MyBinder you can download the notebooks by right clicking and pressing download.

**Please do not use ChatGPT, you could search the internet but please don't take an entire solution.**
